You must work on this project in groups of 2, 3, or 4. I strongly recommend groups of 3 or 4, and close coordination of efforts among all group members. Do not divide the work early and then hope to pull everything together in a day or two. Also, make sure everyone has enough to work on independently; don't try to do everything all together. This assignment is intended to exercise your teamwork skills! You will be asked to describe your own role in the project, along with each of your teammate's roles. Everyone is expected to contribute significantly.
